this was the introduction to data structure and algorithm. 
why they are so important and useful in software development

data structure is the way which data are organized in a computer for effiency.

algorithm is the step by step process of performing a task...

he give alot of examples and usecases of  data structure and algorithm...
why it's vital to master data structure and algorithm for software developers...

data structure can be divided into:
  1. primitive data
  2. Non-primitive data

algorithm can be divided into:

  1.Dynamic algorithm
  2. Recursive algorithm
  3. Greedy algorithm
  4. Divide and conquer algorithm
  5.
